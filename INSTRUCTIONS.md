===================
FAST & BASIC START.
===================
1. Open the project in IDE (Current to 12/19/2020 I'm using VSCode).
2. Open the following file in the src/settings/settings.js file.
3. Search for the first setting - 'IS_CREATE_COURSES_METHOD_ACTIVE' and 'IS_PURCHASE_COURSES_METHOD_ACTIVE' - Make sure they are set to true.
4. Next - Time to install the NPM packages. On the terminal run 'npm run i'.
5. Once finished with the node_modules installation, it's time to set up your date.
6. Open once again the Open the following file in the src/settings/settings.js file.
7. Go to the 'COURSES_DATES_VALUE' setting and change the date to the desaired date. If you want the date of current day, don't change anything.
8. You are ready to start to crawl.
9. On terminal run 'npm start'. If everything goes well, you will start to see the console status line appear.
10. If you see any error - Need to check what's change. Current to 12/19/2020, It works fine.
11. If you see the console status line but the 'Course' not progressing - Need to check what's wrong.
12. If no errors and the progress works OK, make sure to check on dist/date of today (Example: 1_20200316_222124)/ That all TXT
